// Classes

// A class is the set of instructions that describe how an instance can behave and what information it contains.
// Java has predefined classes such as System, which we’ve used in logging text to our screen, but we will often have to create our own classes.

// General Structure
// Here’s a definition of a Java class:



public class Car {
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
 
  }
 
}
